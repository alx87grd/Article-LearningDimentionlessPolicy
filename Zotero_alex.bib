In this work, we investigate how the redundancy of such a system can be exploited in order to make it more energy efficient. The system under study consists of two drivetrains coupled to a planetary differential. Both drivetrains are composed of a geared DC motor and a holding brake. First, we derive an accurate semi-empirical model of this system and prove its validity on a test setup. Based on this model, which includes nonlinear friction terms, we analyze how the power flows and energy losses depend on the redundant degree of freedom. Furthermore, we discuss how the design of the actuator can be optimized for energy efficiency. This strategy is applied to a case study, where a 250 W geared DC motor is replaced by a more efficient dual-motor actuator. Experiments confirm that a dual-motor actuator succeeds in reducing the energy consumption at various loads and speeds. We also show that the results are very sensitive to friction and other speed- and load-dependent losses.},

The MR-TDM concept combines the advantages of lightweight electric geared motors with the high dynamic performance of MR clutches. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the overall performance of the MR-TDM and demonstrate its wide range of applications. Analytical studies show the higher open-loop natural frequency (60 Hz) and lower reflected output inertia of the MR-TDM compared to the TDM powered by traditional actuators.

In this paper, a new closed-loop, field-programable-gate-array (FPGA)-based control scheme to linearize an MR clutch's input-output relationship is presented. The feedback signal used in this control scheme is the magnetic field acquired from hall sensors within the MR clutch. The FPGA board uses this feedback signal to compensate for the nonlinear behavior of the MR clutch using an estimated model of the clutch magnetic field. The local use of an FPGA board will dramatically simplify the use of MR clutches for torque actuation. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated using an experimental platform that includes an MR clutch as part of a compliant actuation mechanism. The results clearly demonstrate that the use of the proposed FPGA-based closed-loop control scheme can effectively eliminate hysteretic behaviors of the MR clutch, allowing to have linear actuators with predictable behaviors.},

	abstract = {Background
Many soldiers are expected to carry heavy loads over extended distances, often resulting in physical and mental fatigue. In this study, the design and testing of an autonomous leg exoskeleton is presented. The aim of the device is to reduce the energetic cost of loaded walking. In addition, we present the Augmentation Factor, a general framework of exoskeletal performance that unifies our results with the varying abilities of previously developed exoskeletons.

Methods
We developed an autonomous battery powered exoskeleton that is capable of providing substantial levels of positive mechanical power to the ankle during the push-off region of stance phase. We measured the metabolic energy consumption of seven subjects walking on a level treadmill at 1.5 m/s, while wearing a 23 kg vest.

Results
During the push-off portion of the stance phase, the exoskeleton applied positive mechanical power with an average across the gait cycle equal to 23 ± 2 W (11.5 W per ankle). Use of the autonomous leg exoskeleton significantly reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 36 ± 12 W, which was an improvement of 8 ± 3\% (p = 0.025) relative to the control condition of not wearing the exoskeleton.

Conclusions
In the design of leg exoskeletons, the results of this study highlight the importance of minimizing exoskeletal power dissipation and added limb mass, while providing substantial positive power during the walking gait cycle.},

From scampering through life-size mazes to cracking codes, we revel in the simplicity and difficulty of these tasks. As contestants totter precariously, we find ourselves wondering about the difficulty of their challenge: standing on one foot with arms outstretched for as long as possible.  10 seconds.  30 seconds.  1 minute.  …collapsing one after another until the winner remains standing.  For something as seemingly easy as holding your arms outstretched, imagine how much more difficult it would be if in your hands were a 30-pound sandblaster. Thirty pounds doesn’t sound like much, but consider that it is roughly the weight of an average toddler, four one-gallon jugs of milk or six laptops. Odds are you wouldn’t be able to hold the weight for long before needing to rest.  This is a common scenario in the industrial sector where workers must use heavy, hand-operated tools to complete their tasks. Whether grinding barnacles off a ship’s hull or welding a long section of beam, daily industrial work can be physically exhausting. That’s where exoskeleton technology comes in.  “Exoskeletons can enhance a person’s physical capabilities,” said Patricia Aelker, program manager of Lockheed Martin’s exoskeleton technologies. “To increase strength or endurance, you must have a keen understanding about the structure of the human body, the science of how the body moves and the variations among individuals.”  Using that information, as well as lessons from previous proof-of-concept designs, the team developed the FORTIS™ exoskeleton, which comfortably accommodates multiple body types while increasing endurance and productivity. FORTIS™ exoskeleton Understanding the differences of individual bodies, the FORTIS team designed the exoskeleton to be adjustable to fit a range of body sizes and types.  The FORTIS exoskeleton takes the weight of a load, like a heavy hand tool, off operators, making it easier for them to do their work. Using the principles of biomechanics, the weight is transferred to a mechanical arm and down to the ground through a series of joints, similar to the joints in your hips, knees and ankles.},

The additional mechanism has two favourable features. On the one hand it exhibits an almost iso-elastic behaviour whereby the lifting force of the mechanism is constant for a wide working range. Secondly, the value of the supporting force can be varied by a simple linear movement of a supporting joint. Furthermore a standard tension spring can be used to gain the desired behavior. The additional mechanism is a 4-link mechanism affixed to one end of the spring within the parallelogram arm-support. It has several geometrical parameters which influence the overall behaviour. A standard optimisation routine with constraints on the parameters is used to find an optimal set of geometrical parameters. Based on the optimized geometrical parameters a prototype was constructed and tested. It is a lightweight wearable system, with a weight of 1.9 kg. Detailed experiments reveal a difference between measured and calculated forces. These variations can be explained by a 60 \% higher pre load force of the tension spring and a geometrical offset in the construction.},

	abstract = {Humans possess the remarkable ability to control their four natural limbs in a voluntary, accurate and independent manner. The simultaneous use of two or more limbs allows humans to learn and robustly perform a wide range of complex tasks. Since the use of multiple limbs enables humans to master advanced motor skills, it would be interesting to study whether having additional limbs would enable users to expand their skill set beyond its natural limits. Inspired by this vision, we propose a new form of human augmentation: a wearable robot that augments its user by providing him with an additional set of robotic limbs. We named this new device Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL). However, humans have never had the possibility to control additional, powered limbs besides their natural arms and legs. The main theme of this thesis, besides realizing a prototype of the robot and proving its usefulness in realworld tasks, is demonstrating that humans can voluntarily control additional limbs as if they were a part of their own body. We realized a lightweight (3.5 kg), comfortable prototype of the SRL that can be easily worn by an unassisted user. Two robotic limbs can assist the user in both manufacturing and locomotion tasks. We created control strategies that take advantage of the independence of the robotic limbs, enabling them to provide optimal assistance in specific tasks such as weight support, body stabilization, using powered tools, sitting/standing and dynamic walking. Finally, we developed an EMG-based control interface that enables users to voluntarily control the motion of the robotic limbs, without interfering with the posture of the rest of the body. The new augmentation technology presented in this thesis opens up new possibilities in the field of wearable robotics. The voluntary control of additional robotic limbs falls within the range of motor skills that humans can learn, and enables the acquisition of a new set of complex skills that would not be achievable using only the natural body..},

	abstract = {Bridging the 'reality gap' that separates simulated robotics from experiments on hardware could accelerate robotic research through improved data availability. This paper explores domain randomization, a simple technique for training models on simulated images that transfer to real images by randomizing rendering in the simulator. With enough variability in the simulator, the real world may appear to the model as just another variation. We focus on the task of object localization, which is a stepping stone to general robotic manipulation skills. We find that it is possible to train a real-world object detector that is accurate to \$1.5\$cm and robust to distractors and partial occlusions using only data from a simulator with non-realistic random textures. To demonstrate the capabilities of our detectors, we show they can be used to perform grasping in a cluttered environment. To our knowledge, this is the first successful transfer of a deep neural network trained only on simulated RGB images (without pre-training on real images) to the real world for the purpose of robotic control.},

	abstract = {Discovery of fundamental principles which govern and limit effective locomotion (self-propulsion) is of intellectual interest and practical importance. Human technology has created robotic moving systems that excel in movement on and within environments of societal interest: paved roads, open air and water. However, such devices cannot yet robustly and efficiently navigate (as animals do) the enormous diversity of natural environments which might be of future interest for autonomous robots; examples include vertical surfaces like trees and cliffs, heterogeneous ground like desert rubble and brush, turbulent flows found near seashores, and deformable/flowable substrates like sand, mud and soil. In this review we argue for the creation of a physics of moving systems—a ‘locomotion robophysics’—which we define as the pursuit of principles of self-generated motion. Robophysics can provide an important intellectual complement to the discipline of robotics, largely the domain of researchers from engineering and computer science. The essential idea is that we must complement the study of complex robots in complex situations with systematic study of simplified robotic devices in controlled laboratory settings and in simplified theoretical models. We must thus use the methods of physics to examine both locomotor successes and failures using parameter space exploration, systematic control, and techniques from dynamical systems. Using examples from our and others’ research, we will discuss how such robophysical studies have begun to aid engineers in the creation of devices that have begun to achieve life-like locomotor abilities on and within complex environments, have inspired interesting physics questions in low dimensional dynamical systems, geometric mechanics and soft matter physics, and have been useful to develop models for biological locomotion in complex terrain. The rapidly decreasing cost of constructing robot models with easy access to significant computational power bodes well for scientists and engineers to engage in a discipline which can readily integrate experiment, theory and computation.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a Learning-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (LB-NMPC) algorithm for an autonomous mobile robot to reduce path-tracking errors over repeated traverses along a reference path. The LB-NMPC algorithm uses a simple a priori vehicle model and a learned disturbance model. Disturbances are modelled as a Gaussian Process (GP) based on experience collected during previous traversals as a function of system state, input and other relevant variables. Modelling the disturbance as a GP enables interpolation and extrapolation of learned disturbances, a key feature of this algorithm. Localization for the controller is provided by an on-board, vision-based mapping and navigation system enabling operation in large-scale, GPS-denied environments. The paper presents experimental results including over 1.8 km of travel by a four-wheeled, 50 kg robot travelling through challenging terrain (including steep, uneven hills) and by a six-wheeled, 160 kg robot learning disturbances caused by unmodelled dynamics at speeds ranging from 0.35 m/s to 1.0 m/s. The speed is scheduled to balance trial time, path-tracking errors, and localization reliability based on previous experience. The results show that the system can start from a generic a priori vehicle model and subsequently learn to reduce vehicle- and trajectory-specific path-tracking errors based on experience.},

It offers an excellent perspective on techniques as well as an active knowledge of key approaches. Readers will acquire a well-developed sense of when to use adaptive techniques and when other methods are more appropriate.Starting with a broad overview, the text explores real-time estimation, self-tuning regulators and model-reference adaptive systems, stochastic adaptive control, and automatic tuning of regulators. Additional topics include gain scheduling, robust high-gain control and self-oscillating controllers, and suggestions for implementing adaptive controllers. Concluding chapters feature a summary of applications and a brief review of additional areas closely related to adaptive control.Both authors are Professors at the Lund Institute of Technology in Sweden, and this text has evolved from their many years of research and teaching. Their insights into properties, design procedures, and implementation of adaptive controllers are complemented by the numerous examples, simulations, and problems that appear throughout the book.},

	abstract = {More than 15 years after model predictive control (MPC) appeared in industry as an effective means to deal with multivariable constrained control problems, a theoretical basis for this technique has started to emerge. The issues of feasibility of the on-line optimization, stability and performance are largely understood for systems described by linear models. Much progress has been made on these issues for non-linear systems but for practical applications many questions remain, including the reliability and efficiency of the on-line computation scheme. To deal with model uncertainty ‘rigorously’ an involved dynamic programming problem must be solved. The approximation techniques proposed for this purpose are largely at a conceptual stage. Among the broader research needs the following areas are identified: multivariable system identification, performance monitoring and diagnostics, non-linear state estimation, and batch system control. Many practical problems like control objective prioritization and symptom-aided diagnosis can be integrated systematically and effectively into the MPC framework by expanding the problem formulation to include integer variables yielding a mixed-integer quadratic or linear program. Efficient techniques for solving these problems are becoming available.},

Our experimental results significantly extend the state of the art in autonomous helicopter flight. We used the following approach: First we had a pilot fly the helicopter to help us find a helicopter dynamics model and a reward (cost) function. Then we used a reinforcement learning (optimal control) algorithm to find a controller that is optimized for the resulting model and reward function.

	abstract = {"Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject." -- Elon Musk, cochair of OpenAI; cofounder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceXDeep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

	shorttitle = {Mind {Children}},
	abstract = {Imagine attending a lecture at the turn of the twentieth century in which Orville Wright speculates about the future of transportation, or one in which Alexander Graham Bell envisages satellite communications and global data banks. Mind Children, written by an internationally renowned roboticist, offers a comparable experience-a mind-boggling glimpse of a world we may soon share with our artificial progeny. Filled with fresh ideas and insights, this book is one of the most engaging and controversial visions of the future ever written by a serious scholar. Hans Moravec convincingly argues that we are approaching a watershed in the history of life-a time when the boundaries between biological and postbiological intelligence will begin to dissolve. Within forty years, Moravec believes, we will achieve human equivalence in our machines, not only in their capacity to reason but also in their ability to perceive, interact with, and change their complex environment. The critical factor is mobility. A computer rooted to one place is doomed to static iterations, whereas a machine on the prowl, like a mobile organism, must evolve a richer fund of knowledge about an ever-changing world upon which to base its actions. In order to achieve anything near human equivalence, robots will need, at the least, the capacity to perform ten trillion calculations per second. Given the trillion-fold increase in computational power since the end of the nineteenth century, and the promise of exotic technologies far surpassing the now-familiar lasers and even superconductors, Moravec concludes that our hardware will have no trouble meeting this forty-year timetable. But human equivalence is just the beginning, not an upper bound. Once the tireless thinking capacity of robots is directed to the problem of their own improvement and reproduction, even the sky will not limit their voracious exploration of the universe. In the concluding chapters Moravec challenges us to imagine with him the possibilities and pitfalls of such a scenario. Rather than warning us of takeover by robots, the author invites us, as we approach the end of this millennium, to speculate about a plausible, wonderful postbiological future and the ways in which our minds might participate in its unfolding.},

To learn hand-eye coordination for grasping, we trained a large convolutional neural network to predict the probability that task-space motion of the gripper will result in successful grasps, using only monocular camera images and independently of camera calibration or the current robot pose. This requires the network to observe the spatial relationship between the gripper and objects in the scene, thus learning hand-eye coordination. We then use this network to servo the gripper in real time to achieve successful grasps. To train our network, we collected over 800,000 grasp attempts over the course of two months, using between 6 and 14 robotic manipulators at any given time, with differences in camera placement and hardware. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method achieves effective real-time control, can successfully grasp novel objects, and corrects mistakes by continuous servoing.},

Mathematical models of the jam-free and stable meshing condition of the proposed mechanism are developed and experimentally verified, along with a discussion and recommendations to be considered as design guidelines. Additionally, a singularly actuated robotic joint prototype is developed to examine the performance of the proposed clutch mechanism. The joint was driven by a small 2-W DC motor.

The SRL can work closely with the wearer by holding an object, positioning a workpiece, operating a powered tool, securing the human body, and more. Although the SRL has the potential to provide the wearer with greater strength, higher accuracy, flexibility, and dexterity, its control performance is hindered by unpredictable disturbances due to involuntary motions of the wearer, which include postural sway and physiological tremor. This paper presents 1) a Kalman filter approach to estimate the state of the SRL despite the involuntary wearer's motion, and 2) a method for improving the accuracy and stabilizing the human body and the SRL. The dynamics of the human-SRL system are analyzed, including human-induced disturbance models based on biomechanics literature. A discrete Kalman filter is constructed and its performance is evaluated in terms of error covariance. A “bracing” technique is then introduced to suppress the human-induced disturbances; one robotic limb grasps an environment structure and uses it as a support to attenuate the disturbances. We show how bracing can be used to shape the stiffness parameters at the robot base. This in turn allows to enhance state estimation accuracy in the areas of the workspace where the user needs assistance.},

Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL) can hold objects, clamp them to a fixture, guide and support human hands, and assist the wearer in performing a task as a close co-worker. This paper focuses on a class of tasks where SRL physically interacts with the environment through contact. SRL makes contact with a wall and thereby braces the human body against the environment. SRL also guides the human hands by placing a drill jig over the drilling location. Bracing the human body and guiding the hands, SRL can enhance the drilling task stability and accuracy. The SRL technology is applied to aircraft assembly, where conventional industrial robots failed to perform effectively. First, the basic design concept of SRL is summarized, and task strategies using SRL and their functional requirements are described. Kinematic and static properties resulting from the structural closed loops formed around the SRL, the human, and the environment are analyzed, and effective strategies for physical disturbance rejection and fine positioning are discussed. A prototype robotic arm grasps the aircraft fuselage structure. Another robotic arm places a drill jig precisely on the fuselage structure, and guides and stabilizes a hand drill held by the human user. An optimization method is developed in order to identify the SRL kinematic configuration and joint torques that stabilize the drill and at the same time minimize the human workload.},

	abstract = {A wearable robot secured on the shoulder of a human is developed for assisting its wearer in the execution of tasks in the overhead workspace. Installing a ceiling panel is an example of such a task. During this task the robot can hold the panel or collaborate actively with the human in order to fix the panel with the appropriate equipment. This wearable robot, termed "Supernumerary Robotic Limbs", works closely with the human to streamline the operation and reduce the human workload. First, the design concept of the Robot-on-the-Shoulder system is described, and a new approach to the coordinated control between the wearable robot and the human is presented. A graphical task process representation based on Coloured Petri Nets (CPN) is used to model the concurrent and distributed nature of the human-robot system, which comprises two human hands and two robot hands. The CPN framework is then extended to a type of hybrid control system by imbedding local dynamic controllers in the Transition nodes of the CPN model. Each local dynamic controller collects sensor signals relevant to the target transition and makes a predictive control decision. This allows the robot on the shoulder to take a proactive and preemptive action as well as to confirm a successful Transition. The control parameters for these algorithms are tuned based on "teaching-by-showing" techniques using human demonstration data. Partial Least Squares is used for extracting significant sensor signals from high-dimensional sensor data in order to do real time predictions and control. A prototype robot-on-the-shoulder system is built, and the CPN hybrid control is implemented and tested for a ceiling panel installation task.},

Electric vehicles (EVs) with a single-ratio gearbox may provide high levels of smoothness, but using a multi-speed gearbox provides significant benefits in terms of vehicle acceleration, top speed, powertrain cost, mass, and energy consumption. AMTs can provide smooth shifts without torque interruption when coupled to a normally-open torque bypass clutch. However, conventional dry friction clutches are not best suited for such torque bypass due to wear and controllability concerns, while wet clutches would decrease powertrain efficiency due to viscous losses. An eddy current clutch would be highly controllable, simple to manufacture, low-cost, robust, and do not wear compared to friction clutches. The potential of eddy current clutches is assessed from a representative case study consisting of a ∼190 Nm clutch for a seamless two-speed AMT. The clutch design is based upon Wouterse's model, which is further refined using a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) on the clutch magnetic circuit. A prototype clutch is built and installed inside an existing AMT. The measured clutch coupling torque agrees well with Wouterse's model results, with a maximum error of 6\%. The AMT performed seamless gear upshifts on a test bench thanks to the eddy current clutch, which confirms their viability for torque bypass.},

In particular, Automated Manual Transmissions (AMTs) have characteristics of smooth shifts without torque interruption when coupled to a torque bypass clutch. However, conventional friction clutches are not best suited as torque bypass clutches because of their limited controllability and because large amount of heat must be dissipated to slow down the motor during gearshifts. This paper studies the feasibility of a seamless AMT architecture for EVs and Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) using an eddy current torque bypass clutch that is highly controllable, robust, low cost, and has no wearable parts. A system-level study using a backward-facing model is used to assess the advantages of multi-speed gearboxes for EVs in terms of energy consumption, powertrain cost, and mass. A full-scale clutch prototype is designed for a custom two-speed AMT of an 80 kW EV. Numerical simulations show that a two-speed gearbox can improve energy consumption by 7.2 \% for a compact class EV such as the Nissan Leaf. Moreover, using two gear ratios allows a downsizing of the electric motor, which could reduce powertrain cost and mass by 23.1 \% and 15.6 \%, respectively. The clutch is characterized experimentally and its maximum torque agrees well with analytical results (within 6 \%). The prototype performed a seamless shift on a test bench demonstrating the viability of using an eddy current clutch for torque bypass clutches in AMTs.},

	doi = {10.1109/VPPC.2009.5289707},
	abstract = {The current level of interest in electric vehicles (EVs) could hardly be overstated as manufacturers and governments around the world appear to have increased interest at a staggering rate. The resurgence of current interest in the early part of the 21st century has been driven by both political and technological developments, namely a requirement to control global emissions and the emergence of new battery designs with improved specific energy, energy density and rechargability properties. One of the great advantages of the electric motor is its torque characteristic which provides maximum torque from zero up to low speeds, and then it is governed by the maximum power available as motor speed increase. This has two significant advantages over the typical torque-speed properties of the competing IC engine: (1) It is fundamentally a more desirable characteristic spread of torque over the speed range in contrast to the peakiness of an IC engine. (2) It removes the need for any additional transmission clutch or gears. However, one of the main conclusions to emerge from the plethora of research work into energy efficient vehicles is that it is necessary to pursue every possible avenue for minor efficiency gains. It is therefore of interest to investigate whether it is possible to manage the efficiency of the electric motor, so that by using an intermediate gearbox the motor is operated more often in its higher efficiency region. The aim of this paper is to develop a simple EV model and predict its energy consumption with a variable and fixed ratio gearbox over a standard driving cycle in order to understand whether this could offer significant efficiency gains. The emerging conclusions are that it is possible to improve overall energy consumption levels by around 5 to 12\% with a variable ratio gearbox depending on the driving cycle used. However, there are many other practical considerations which must be weighed against this positive result and the paper discusses the - impact of several of these such as, gearbox efficiency, additional weight, cost and complexity, effect on drivability and potential for motor downsizing.},

	abstract = {This paper describes work being conducted by OC Robotics and Airbus to develop snake-arm robots to conduct assembly tasks within wing boxes - an area currently inaccessible for automation.The composite, single skin construction of aircraft structures presents new assembly challenges. Currently during box close-out it is necessary for aircraft fitters to climb into the wing box through small access panels and use manual or power tools to perform a variety of tasks. In future wing designs it may be that certain parts of the wing do not provide adequate access for manual assembly methods. It is also known that these manual interventions introduce health and safety concerns with their associated costs.Snake-arm robots provide a means to replace manual procedures by delivering the required tools to all areas of the wing box.Such a development has broader implications for aircraft design and assembly. There is potential for considerable cost savings for the aerospace industry through reduced weight, improved aerodynamics, standardisation of assembly processes, increased rate and reduced health and safety costs.This paper presents early results of the demonstration snake-arm robot and outlines expectations for future development. It also identifies critical design parameters for the snake-arm and considers the tools and processes delivered by the snake-arm.},

	abstract = {It is traditional to make the interface between an actuator and its load as stiff as possible. Despite this tradition, reducing interface stiffness offers a number of advantages, including greater shock tolerance, lower reflected inertia, more accurate and stable force control, less inadvertent damage to the environment, and the capacity for energy storage. As a trade-off, reducing interface stiffness also lowers zero motion force bandwidth. In this paper, the authors propose that for natural tasks, zero motion force bandwidth isn't everything, and incorporating series elasticity as a purposeful element within the actuator is a good idea. The authors use the term elasticity instead of compliance to indicate the presence of a passive mechanical spring in the actuator. After a discussion of the trade-offs inherent in series elastic actuators, the authors present a control system for their use under general force or impedance control. The authors conclude with test results from a revolute series-elastic actuator meant for the arms of the MIT humanoid robot Cog and for a small planetary rover},

For such problems, we need to seek both the optimal switching instants and the optimal continuous inputs. In order to search for the optimal switching instants, the derivatives of the optimal cost with respect to the switching instants need to be known. The most important contribution of the paper is a method which first transcribes an optimal control problem into an equivalent problem parameterized by the switching instants and then obtains the values of the derivatives based on the solution of a two point boundary value differential algebraic equation formed by the state, costate, stationarity equations, the boundary and continuity conditions, along with their differentiations. This method is applied to general switched linear quadratic problems and an efficient method based on the solution of an initial value ordinary differential equation is developed. An extension of the method is also applied to problems with internally forced switching. Examples are shown to illustrate the results in the paper.},

To that end a series of power-on and power-off shift control strategies are then developed for both up and down gear shifts, taking note of the friction load requirements to maintain positive driving load for power-on shifting. A mathematical model of an electric vehicle powertrain is developed including a DC equivalent circuit model for the electric machine and multi-body dynamic model of the powertrain system is then developed and integrated with a hydraulic clutch control system model. Integral control of the powertrain is then performed through simulations on the develop powertrain system model for each of the four shift cases. These simulation results are then replicated on a full scale powertrain test rig. To evaluate the performance of results shift duration and vehicle jerk are used as metrics to demonstrate that the presented strategies are effective for shift control in electric vehicles.

In this rapidly growing and transversal research field, systems involving more than one active element (typically motors) for each actuated degree of freedom are being investigated to allow separate position and impedance regulations. Considering the wide range of applications and the large number of different arrangements deriving from the combination of two active elements and passive elastic components, several actuation architectures have been devised.

This paper reviews state-of-the-art rotary variable impedance units incorporating two separate motors. Existing devices are grouped in three main categories. A critical and comparative analysis of the most relevant features is carried out, also based on most representative prototypes. Recently proposed methodologies and evaluation criteria for design optimization are illustrated and perspectives on potential applications of double actuation systems are presented.},

This effort has been a direct consequence of the growing environmental concern imposing the directives of reduced exhaust emissions and increased vehicle efficiency on current vehicle manufacturers and users. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) offers a continuum of gear ratios between desired limits, which consequently enhances the fuel economy and dynamic performance of a vehicle by better matching the engine operating conditions to the variable driving scenarios. Although a CVT plays a crucial role in the plan to improve vehicle fuel economy, its complete potential has not been realized in a mass-production vehicle. The current paper reviews the state-of-the-art research on dynamic modeling and control of friction-limited continuously variable transmissions. The basic concepts, mathematical models, and computational schemes are extensively discussed. Challenges and critical issues for future research on modeling and control of such CVTs are also discussed.},

Since the actuator system to be proposed consists of dual-motors and a planetary gear, it is referred to as the dual-motor system using a planetary gear (DuPG) in this paper. The suggested DuPG improves the speed-torque performance by combining two motors with one planetary gear, in which one motor is for high speed and the other for high torque. In other words, it is able to realize a high speed at low torque, and high torque at low speed, as an automatic transmission operates in an automobile. The proposed actuator system is able to extend the speed/torque operation region. Finally, several experimental results are suggested to show a few advantages such as the extended speed/torque operation region and the enhanced energy efficiency.},

While they share many of the beneficial properties of existing randomized planning techniques, RRTs are specifically designed to handle nonholonomic constraints (including dynamics) and high degrees of freedom. An RRT is iteratively expanded by applying control inputs that drive the system slightly toward randomly-selected points, as opposed to requiring point-to-point convergence, as in the probabilistic roadmap approach. Several desirable properties and a basic implementation of RRTs are discussed. To date, we have successfully applied RRTs to holonomic, nonholonomic, and kinodynamic planning problems of up to twelve degrees of freedom.},

	abstract = {Control of a robot manipulator in contact with the environment is usually conducted by the direct feedback control system using a force-torque sensor or the indirect impedance control scheme. Although these methods have been successfully applied to many applications, simultaneous control of force and position cannot be achieved. Furthermore, collision safety has been of primary concern in recent years with emergence of service robots in direct contact with humans. To cope with such problems, redundant actuation has been used to enhance the performance of a position/force controller. In this paper, the novel design of a double actuator unit (DAU) composed of double actuators and a planetary gear train is proposed to provide the capability of simultaneous control of position and force as well as the improved collision safety. Since one actuator controls position and the other actuator modulates stiffness, DAU can control the position and stiffness simultaneously at the same joint. The torque exerted on the joint can be estimated without an expensive torque/force sensor. DAU is capable of detecting dynamic collision by monitoring the speed of the stiffness modulator. Upon detection of dynamic collision, DAU immediately reduces its joint stiffness according to the collision magnitude, thus providing the optimum collision safety. It is shown from various experiments that DAU can provide good performance of position tracking, force estimation and collision safety.},

The optimal control problem has its origin in automobile test-driving, where the car model involves a discrete-valued control function for the gear shift. Since the number of variables in (MINLP) grows with the number of grid points used for discretization of the optimal control problem, the example from automobile test-driving may serve as a benchmark problem of scalable complexity. Reference solutions are computed numerically for two different problem sizes. A simple heuristic approach suitable for optimal control problems is suggested that reduces the computational amount considerably, though it cannot guarantee optimality anymore.

After the gear ratios are optimized using Dynamic Programming, gear shift control is addressed, and smooth shift process without torque hole is achieved through feed-forward and feed-back control of the clutch and the motor. Finally the proposed electric vehicle (EV) is compared with an EV with fixed-ratio gear box, and it is shown that the 2-speed AMT with a rear-mounted dry clutch has much better performance in terms of acceleration time, maximum speed and energy economy.

	abstract = {This paper describes the design concept of a new robot based on the direct-drive method using rare-earth d-c torque motors. Because these motors have high torque, light weight and compact size, we can construct robots with far better performance than those presently available. For example, we can eliminate all the transmission mechanisms, such as reducers and chain belts, between the motors and their loads, and construct a simple mechanism (direct-drive) where the arm links are directly coupled to the motor rotors. This elimination can lead to excellent performance: no backlash, low friction, low inertia, low compliance and high reliability, all of which are suited for high-speed, high-precision robots. First we propose a basic configuration of direct-drive robots. Second a general procedure for designing direct-drive robots is shown, and the feasibility of direct drive for robot actuation is discussed in terms of weights and torques of joints. One of the difficulties in designing direct-drive robots is that motors to drive wrist joints are loads for motors to drive elbow joints, and they are loads for motors at shoulders. To reduce this increasing series of loads is an essential issue for designing practical robots. We analyze the joint mass system for simplified kinematic model of the direct-drive robots, and show how the loads are reduced significantly by using rare-earth motors with light-weight and high torque. We also discuss optimum kinematic structures with minimum arm weight. Finally, we describe the direct-drive robotic manipulator (CMU arm) developed at Carnegie-Mellon University, and verify the design theory.},

	abstract = {The body representation in the human mind is dynamic, and illusions or traumatic events can modify it to include additional limbs. This remarkable adaptability of the central nervous system to different body configurations opens new possibilities in the field of human augmentation. In order to fully exploit this potential, we developed a new type of wearable co-robot that can perform tasks in close coordination with the human user. The system, named Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL), consists of two additional robotic arms worn through a backpack-like harness. The SRL can assist the user by holding objects, lifting weights and streamlining the execution of a task. If the SRL perform movements closely coordinated with the user and exhibit human-like dynamics, they might be incorporated into the body representation and perceived as parts of the user's body. As a result, the human would be able to extend the range of available skills and manipulation possibilities, performing tasks more effectively and with less effort. This paper presents a communication, estimation and control method for the SRL, aimed to perform tasks in tight coordination with the wearer. The SRL observes the user motion, and actively assists the human by employing a coordinated control algorithm. In particular, skills involving the direct cooperation of two human workers are transferred to the SRL and a single user. Demonstration data of the two humans - a leader and an assistant - are analyzed and a state estimation algorithm is extracted from them. This can be used to control the SRL accordingly with the used end effectors. A causal relationship relating the assistant's motion to the leader's motion is identified based on System Identification methods. This approach is applied to a drilling operation performed by two workers. An effective coordination skill is identified and transferred to the SRL, to make them act like the human follower.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel high-backdrivable parallel-link manipulator with Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) mechanism using several shaft actuators. The backdrivability is important and necessary for robots that operate around our life space to guarantee the safety of us, themselves and environments. A rotational actuator with a high reduction ratio reducer has been commonly used in traditional robotics field, but it cannot realize the high-backdrivability without any sensory feedback. In this study, several high-backdrivable shaft actuators are used instead of it. Moreover, the CVT mechanism which is brought by a novel configuration of the parallel mechanism is employed effectively. To utilize multiple shaft actuators with the CVT mechanism is able to surmount a drawback of the shaft actuator whose output force is relatively weak. A simple 1 DOF manipulator is proposed as the first step of this study. Firstly, its kinematic and dynamic models are given. Next, a PD type feedback control signal to regulate the arm's angle and the CVT simultaneously is designed. A static relation between an output end-point force and the CVT mechanism is analyzed. Finally, several fundamental experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of proposed mechanism.},

We solve for the optimal high-level feedback policy to negotiate a perfectly known but qualitatively complex terrain, using a fixed low-level controller which selects a high-level action once- per-step. We also demonstrate that a one-step time horizon control strategy using the same low-level controller can provide performance which is surprisingly comparable to that of the infinite time horizon optimal policy. The model presented here uses a torque at the hip and an axially-directed impulsive toe-off applied just before each ground collision. Our results provide compelling evidence that actuated robots based on passive dynamic principles (e.g. no ankle torque) should inherently be capable of walking on significantly rough terrain.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the closed-loop control of an actuator with both a continuous input variable (motor torque) and a discrete input variable (mode selection). In many applications, robots have to bear large loads while moving slowly and also have to move quickly through the air with almost no load, leading to conflicting requirements for their actuators. An actuator with multiple gear ratios, like in a powertrain, can address this issue by allowing an effective use of power over a wide range of output speed. However, having discrete modes of operation adds complexity to the high-level control and planning. Here a controller for two-speed actuators that automatically select both the best gear ratio and the motor torque is developed. The approach is to: first derive a low-dimensional model, then use dynamic programming to find the best actions for all possible situations, and last use regression analysis to extract simplified global feedback laws. This approach produces simple practical nearly-optimal feedback laws. A controller that globally minimizes a quadratic cost function is derived for a two-speed actuator prototype, global stability is proven and performance is demonstrated experimentally.},

This leads to conflicting requirements for their actuators. Multiple gear ratios, like in a powertrain, address this issue by allowing an effective use of power over a wide range of output speed. However in robotics, as opposed to powertrains, the controlled load is not always inertial and acting as a low-pass filter; hence gear shifting is a more challenging issue in a robotics context. In this paper, it is proposed to address this problem using a dual-speed dual-motor architecture to maintain full control of the output during gear shifting. A dynamic model is developed and a controller using the redundancy of motors is proposed to enable fast seamless gear shifting even when interacting with unknown dynamic environments.

X-screw has a transmission ratio that automatically changes in response to the load, making it possible to combine relatively high speed motion under low loads with a large maximum load capacity in a much smaller space and with less complexity, than traditional transmission systems. X-screw also has built-in overload protection since it will stop advancing if the load exceeds a certain value although the motor is able to continue to rotate. Furthermore, X-screw can produce arbitrarily slow linear motion from a high speed input, eliminating the need for bulky gear reductions.

	abstract = {Solving an optimal control or estimation problem is not easy. Pieces of the puzzle are found scattered throughout many different disciplines. Furthermore, the focus of this book is on practical methods, that is, methods that I have found actually work! In fact everything described in this book has been implemented in production software and used to solve real optimal control problems. Although the reader should be proficient in advanced mathematics, no theorems are presented. Traditionally, there are two major parts of a successful optimal control or optimal estimation solution technique. The first part is the “optimization” method. The second part is the “differential equation” method. When faced with an optimal control or estimation problem it is tempting to simply “paste” together packages for optimization and numerical integration. While naive approaches such as this may be moderately successful, the goal of this book is to suggest that there is a better way! The methods used to solve the differential equations and optimize the functions are intimately related. The first two chapters of this book focus on the optimization part of the problem. In Chapter 1 the important concepts of nonlinear programming for small dense applications are introduced. Chapter 2 extends the presentation to problems which are both large and sparse. Chapters 3 and 4 address the differential equation part of the problem. Chapter 3 introduces relevant material in the numerical solution of differential (and differentialalgebraic) equations. Methods for solving the optimal control problem are treated in some detail in Chapter 4. Throughout the book the interaction between optimization and integration is emphasized. Chapter 5 describes how to solve optimal estimation problems. Chapter 6 presents a collection of examples that illustrate the various concepts and techniques. Real world problems often require solving a sequence of optimal control and/or optimization problems, and Chapter 7 describes a collection of these “advanced applications.” While the book incorporates a great deal of new material not covered in Practical Methods for Optimal Control Using Nonlinear Programming [21], it does not cover everything. Many important topics are simply not discussed in order to keep the overall presentation concise and focused. The discussion is general and presents a unified approach to solving optimal estimation and control problems. Most of the examples are drawn from my experience in the aerospace industry. Examples have been solved using a particular implementation called  SOCS.{\textless}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{\textgreater} {\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="double-struck"{\textgreater}SOCS{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}.{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater} {\textless}/math{\textgreater}  I have tried to adhere to notational conventions from both optimization and control theory whenever possible.

This paper presents an analytical model for the simulation, analysis and control of shift dynamics for DCT vehicles. A dynamic model and the control logic for the integrated vehicle have been developed using Matlab/Simulink as the simulation platform. The model has been used to study the variation in output torque in response to different clutch pressure profiles during shifts. Optimized clutch pressure profiles have been created for the best possible shift quality based on model simulation. As a numerical example, the model is used for a DCT vehicle to simulate the wide-open throttle performance. Vehicle launch and shift process are both simulated to assess transmission shift quality and validate the effectiveness of the shift control.},

However, MRI systems present a challenging environment with high magnetic fields and limited space, making the development of MRI-compatible robots complex. This paper presents an MRI-compatible pneumatic actuation technology consisting of molded polymer structures with embedded air-muscles operated in a binary fashion. Along with its good positioning accuracy, the technology presents advantages of compactness, perfect MRI-compatibility, simplicity and low cost. Here, we specifically report the design and validation of a transperineal prostate cancer manipulator prototype that has 20 embedded air-muscles distributed in four star-like polymer structures. These compliant structures are made of silicone elastomer, using lost-core injection molding. Low motion hysteresis and good precision are achieved by designing molded joints that eliminate sliding surfaces. An effective design method for such embedded polymer air-muscles is proposed, using a manipulator model and four air-muscle design models: geometrical, finite elements, uniaxial analytic, and experimental. Binary control of each air-muscle ensures stability and accuracy with minimized costs and complexity. The prototype is found MRI-compatible with no observable effects on the signal-to-noise ratio and, with appropriate image feedback, is found to reach targets with precision and accuracy under 0.5 mm. The embedded approach reveals to be a key feature since it reduces hysteresis errors by a factor of ≈7 compared to a previous nonembedded version of the manipulator. The successful validation of this binary manipulator opens the door to a new design paradigm for low cost and highly capable pneumatic robots.},

A binary manipulator using 12 elastically averaged air muscles has been proposed for MRI-guided biopsies and brachytherapies procedures used for prostate cancer diagnostic and treatment. In this design, radially-distributed air muscles position a needle guide relatively to the MRI table. The system constitutes an active compliant mechanism where the compliance relieves the over-constraint imposed by the redundant parallel architecture. This paper presents experimental results for repeatability, accuracy, and stiffness of a fully functional manipulator prototype. Results show an experimental repeatability of 0.1 mm for point-to-point manipulation on a workspace diameter of 80 mm. Manipulator average accuracy is 4.7 mm when based on the nominal (uncalibrated) model and improves to 2.1 mm when using a calibrated model. The estimated stiffness at the end-effector is ∼0.95 N/mm and is sufficient to withstand the needle insertion forces without major deflection. Needle trajectories during state change appear to be primarily driven by the system’s elastic energy gradient. The study shows the manipulator prototype to meet its design criteria and to have the potential of becoming an effective and low-cost manipulator for MRI-guided prostate cancer treatment.},

Low motion hysteresis and good precision are achieved by designing molded joints that eliminate sliding surfaces. An effective design method for such embedded polymer air-muscles is proposed, using a manipulator model and four air-muscle design models: geometrical, finite elements, uniaxial analytic, and experimental. Binary control of each air-muscle ensures stability and accuracy with minimized costs and complexity. The prototype is found MRI-compatible with no observable effects on the signal-to-noise ratio and, with appropriate image feedback, is found to reach targets with precision and accuracy under 0.5 mm. The embedded approach reveals to be a key feature since it reduces hysteresis errors by a factor of ≈7 compared to a previous nonembedded version of the manipulator. The successful validation of this binary manipulator opens the door to a new design paradigm for low cost and highly capable pneumatic robots.},

	abstract = {Hybrid systems are a modeling framework that allows for the combined consideration of continuous and discrete state dynamics. They are described by a finite collection of continuous systems, with each of these continuous dynamics corresponding to discrete modes of operation. Hidden mode hybrid systems are the special case when the mode is unknown or hidden and mode transitions are autonomous. In addition, by allowing unknown inputs in this framework, both deterministic and stochastic disturbance inputs and noise signals can be considered. There are a large number of applications, such as autonomous systems with contact, urban transportation systems, human-automation systems as well as fault and attack identification in cyber-physical systems. However, the literature on feedback control and estimation approaches for such systems is rather sparse. The main contribution of this thesis is the development of fundamental theory and computationally efficient algorithms for feedback control and estimation of hidden mode hybrid systems. In the first part of the thesis, we consider the feedback control problem of hidden mode hybrid systems with input amplitude and rate constraints. We propose a single hidden mode control law that applies to all modes, as opposed to existing control designs in which a controller is designed for each mode and the switching between controllers are based on mode estimates. This technique was applied to the problems of dynamic landing of a helicopter and robot walking without ground contact sensors and to the control of a car with automatic transmission. In the second part of the thesis, we develop inference algorithms for simultaneously estimating states, unknown inputs and hidden modes of stochastic switched linear systems, along with an analysis of their properties. We first design simultaneous state and input estimators for a more general class of linear systems. Then, we make use of a multiple model framework to additionally estimate the hidden mode. These inference algorithms provide the initial steps towards the realization of smart vehicles that can infer the hidden intention of other drivers without explicit communication, as well as smart power grids with reliable estimates despite faults or malicious attacks on its topology, actuators and sensors.},

	url = {http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/103432},
	abstract = {Planning dynamic motions for a legged robot entails addressing both the continuous question of how its joints should move and the combinatorial question of which hand or foot should touch which surface and in what order. Fortunately, these two questions are linked by the centroidal dynamics of the robot, which we can express either in terms of its joint angle trajectories or in terms of its foot placements and applied forces. Based on this insight, I formulate a pair of mathematical programs for planning highly dynamic motions for legged robots. The first is a mixed-integer convex program, specifically, a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP), that yields a sequence of footholds/handholds as well as center of mass (COM) and angular momentum trajectories. The second is a trajectory optimization, formulated as a nonlinear program (NLP), that returns trajectories for the COM, angular momentum, and joint angles subject to the footholds/handholds chosen by the MIQP step. While any number of trajectory optimization schemes could be used here, we present one which is particularly useful in this case, as it enforces the system's dynamics directly in terms of its COM motion and angular momentum. As a result, the solution to the MIQP provides constraints (where each end-effector is required to make contact with the environment) for the NLP and also gives seeds for the decision variables corresponding to the robot's centroidal motion. Thus, the three primary contributions of this thesis are: an MIQP-based approach to gait selection over irregular terrain, a trajectory optimization formulation for floating-base systems subject to external forces and kinematic constraints, and a planning methodology that integrates both of those to generate highly dynamic motions in challenging environments. I apply these techniques to models of a quadruped and a humanoid (Boston Dynamics' LittleDog and Atlas respectively) to generate motion plans for running, jumping, and other dynamic behaviors.},

Based on this principle, lightweight robotic systems can be made fast and strong; exploiting the natural load dynamics for moving at higher speeds (small reduction ratio), while also able to bear a large load through the attenuation of the load dynamics (large reduction ratio). A model-based control algorithm to automatically select the optimal gear-ratios that minimize the total actuator torques for an arbitrary dynamic state and expected uncertainty level is proposed. Also, a novel 3-DoF robot arm using custom actuators with two discrete gear-ratios is presented. The advantages of gear- shifting dynamically are demonstrated through experiments and simulations. Results show that actively changing the gear-ratio using the proposed control algorithms can lead to an order-of- magnitude reduction of necessary actuator torque and power, and also increase robustness to disturbances.},

Traditional electromechanical actuators powering individual joints are unsuitable for our purpose, because of limited space and large payload requirements. We propose an underactuated system which uses a single actuator at the base for the deployment of a multi d.o.f. serial linkage structure. Our proposed system exploits gravitational and gyroscopic torques in the system dynamics to rapidly deploy the system.

These wearable extra fingers can work together with the human fingers and perform tasks that are usually difficult for a single hand.

In this paper, we present a novel method, exploiting redundancies in the elbow, to control a pair of extra robotic fingers, termed Supernumerary Robotic Fingers or SR Fingers for short, to perform “hold-and-manipulate” tasks. Two control protocols are explored here. One protocol enables discrete transition between different modes of motion, while the other continuously controls grasping behavior of the SR Fingers. Four robot assisted “hold-and-manipulate” tasks are examined, including twisting off the cap of a water bottle, opening the lid of a food container, plugging a cable into an electronic device, and mixing salad in a bowl. Through the successful completion of these tasks, we demonstrate that wearable extra fingers have the potential to provide those with impaired hands the opportunity to live with more independence and work more productively.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a systematic methodology for on-site identification and energy-optimal path planning of an industrial robot. The identification experiments are carried out on-site, in a quick, non-invasive way using a CA8335 Qualistar three-phase electrical networks analyser. Next, the collected data is compared with a parametrised dynamic robot model in an optimisation routine. This routine results in the specification of a parametric dynamic robot model. The model is used as a dynamic constraint for a model predictive control problem, where other physical constraints are added i.e. the limited workspace and the constraints on the joint velocities and accelerations. A sequential quadratic programming solver is used to minimise a mechanical energy based cost function. The resulting energy-optimal path is translated into custom robot commands executable on an industrial robot. The systematic methodology is validated on an IRB1600 industrial ABB robot performing a custom pick-and- place operation. The obtained dynamic robot model is given and compared to the collected measurements. To demonstrate the possibility of energy saving by ‘intelligently’ programming a robot trajectory the energy and time-optimal paths are generated taking all physical constraints into account. Simulation results show a significant time and energy improvement (up to 5\%) compared to most trajectories generated by the ABB software. The most remarkable result is that the fastest energy-optimal trajectory turns out to be 4\% more energy efficient and 3\% faster then the commercially available fastest trajectory. Additional stand-still experiments show that activation of the brakes is favoured over an actuated stand-still from an energy point of view, assuming that the start-up time when releasing the brakes is limited.},

This new variable stiffness actuator significantly differs from its predecessor on the mechanism used for the stiffness regulation. While AwAS tunes the stiffness by regulating the position of the compliant elements along the lever arm, AwAS-II changes the position of the lever's pivot point. As a result of the new principle, AwAS-II can change the stiffness in a much broader range (from zero to infinity) even by using softer springs and shorter lever arm, compared to AwAS. This makes the setup of AwAS-II more compact and lighter and improves the stiffness regulation response. To evaluate the aptitude of the fast stiffness adjustment, experiments on reproducing the stiffness profile of the human ankle during the stance phase of a normal walking gait are conducted. Results indicate that AwAS-II is capable of reproducing an interpolated stiffness profile of the ankle while providing a net positive work and thus a sufficient amount of energy as required for the toe-off.},

The joints of the hyper articulated arm have no dedicated actuators but are activated by gravity. By tilting the base link appropriately, the gravitational torque drives the unactuated links to a desired angular position. With simple locking mechanisms, the hyperarticulated arm can change its configuration using only one actuator at the base. This underactuated arm design was motivated by the need for a compact snake-like robot that can go into aircraft wings and perform assembly operations using heavy end-effectors. The dynamics of the unactuated links are essentially second-order nonholonomic constraints for which there are no general methods to design closed-loop control. We propose a nonlinear closed-loop control law that is guaranteed to be stable in positioning one unactuated joint at a time. We synthesize a Lyapunov function to prove the convergence of this control scheme. The Lyapunov function also generates estimates of the domain of convergence of the control law for various control gains. The control algorithm is implemented on a prototype three-link system. Finally, we provide some experimental results to demonstrate the efficacy of the control scheme.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the development of a normal adjustment cell (NAC) in aero-robotic drilling to improve the quality of vertical drilling, by using an intelligent double-eccentric disk normal adjustment mechanism (2-EDNA), a spherical plain bearing and a floating compress module with sensors. After the surface normal vector is calculated based on the laser sensors’ feedback, the 2-EDNA concept is conceived specifically to address the deviation of the spindle from the surface normal at the drilling point. Following the angle calculation, depending on the actual initial position, two precise eccentric disks (PEDs) with an identical eccentric radius are used to rotate with the appropriate angles using two high-resolution DC servomotors. The two PEDs will carry the spindle to coincide with the surface normal, keeping the vertex of the drill bit still to avoid repeated adjustment and position compensation. A series of experiments was conducted on an aeronautical drilling robot platform with a precise NAC. The effect of normal adjustment on bore diameter, drilling force, burr size, drilling heat, and tool wear was analyzed. The results validate that using the NAC in robotic drilling results in greatly improved vertical drilling quality and is attainable in terms of intelligence and accuracy.},

	abstract = {Robots using cellular-like redundant binary actuators could outmatch electric-gearmotor robotic systems in terms of reliability, force-to-weight ratio, and cost. This paper presents a robust fault-tolerant control scheme that is designed to meet the control challenges that are encountered by such robots, i.e., discrete actuator inputs, complex system modeling, and cross-coupling between actuators. In the proposed scheme, a desired vectorial system output, such as a position or a force, is commanded by recruiting actuators based on their influence vectors on the output. No analytical model of the system is needed; influence vectors are identified experimentally by sequentially activating each actuator. For position control tasks, the controller uses a probabilistic approach and a genetic algorithm to determine an optimal combination of actuators to recruit. For motion control tasks, the controller uses a sliding mode approach and independent recruiting decision for each actuator. Experimental results on a four degrees of freedom binary manipulator with 20 actuators confirm the method's effectiveness and its ability to tolerate massive perturbations and numerous actuator failures.},

In this paper, a soft two-DOF dielectric elastomer (DE) sensor is specifically designed to provide accurate position feedback for a soft polymer robotic manipulator. The technology is exemplified on a soft robot intended for MRI-guided prostate interventions. DEs are chosen for their major advantages of softness, high strains, low cost, and embedded multiple-DOF sensing capability, providing excellent system integration. A geometrical model of the proposed DE sensor is developed and compared to experimental results in order to understand sensor mechanics. Using a differential measurement approach, a handmade prototype provided linear sensory behavior and 0.2 mm accuracy on two-DOF. This correlates to a 0.7\% error over the sensor's 30 mm × 30 mm planar range, demonstrating the outstanding potential of DE technology for accurate multiDOF position sensing.},

The variable stiffness approach has been used to address this problem. We propose a hybrid dual actuator unit (HDAU) which is a novel variable stiffness unit design. The HDAU is composed of a hybrid control module based on an adjustable moment arm mechanism and a drive module with two motors. By controlling the relative motion of gears in the hybrid control module, position and stiffness can be simultaneously controlled for the same joint. The HDAU provides a wide range of joint stiffness due to nonlinearity obtained from the adjustable moment arm. The joint stiffness can be kept constant independent of the passive deflection angle of the output shaft. Furthermore, stable interaction can also be achieved because the joint stiffness is indirectly adjusted by position control of the hybrid control module. The characteristics of the HDAU are analyzed in this study. We show by experiment that the HDAU can provide a wide range of stiffness variation and rapid response for stiffness change.},

	abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account, deeply rooted in psychological and neuroscientific perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

A probability-based estimation of the relevance is suggested by first projecting the motion data onto a generic latent space using principal component analysis. The resulting signals are encoded using a mixture of Gaussian/Bernoulli distributions (Gaussian mixture model/Bernoulli mixture model). This provides a measure of the spatio-temporal correlations across the different modalities collected from the robot, which can be used to determine a metric of the imitation performance. The trajectories are then generalized using Gaussian mixture regression. Finally, we analytically compute the trajectory which optimizes the imitation metric and use this to generalize the skill to different contexts},

This capability is well known from humans and is a good example for the outstanding performance of biological systems. However, only since some years intrinsic compliance is considered as a key feature and not a drawback in robot design. Therefore, only very little work has been carried out on exploiting the natural dynamics of elastic arms for such explosive motion sequences. In this paper, we treat the problem of how to optimally achieve maximum link velocity at a given final time for Variable Stiffness Arms. We show that solutions to this problem lead to excitation motions, which enable the robot to move on the link side at much higher speed than on the motor side. In particular, the robot uses the dynamic transfer of elastic joint energy into link side kinetic energy for further acceleration. In our work we consider the practically relevant input and state constraints, and give experimental verification of the developed methods on the new DLR Hand-Arm system.},

In order to deal with this problem, we propose a technique based on dynamic programming which ensures swing-free trajectory tracking. We start by presenting the mathematical model of a quadrotor with suspended load dynamics and kinematics. A high-level planner is used to provide desired waypoints, and then a dynamic programming approach is used to generate the swing-free trajectory for the quadrotor carrying a suspended load.

	abstract = {Anthropomorphic robots that aim to approach human performance agility and efficiency are typically highly redundant not only in their kinematics but also in actuation. Variable-impedance actuators, used to drive many of these devices, are capable of modulating torque and impedance (stiffness and/or damping) simultaneously, continuously, and independently. These actuators are, however, nonlinear and assert numerous constraints, e.g., range, rate, and effort limits on the dynamics. Finding a control strategy that makes use of the intrinsic dynamics and capacity of compliant actuators for such redundant, nonlinear, and constrained systems is nontrivial. In this study, we propose a framework for optimization of torque and impedance profiles in order to maximize task performance, which is tuned to the complex hardware and incorporating real-world actuation constraints. Simulation study and hardware experiments 1) demonstrate the effects of actuation constraints during impedance control, 2) show applicability of the present framework to simultaneous torque and temporal stiffness optimization under constraints that are imposed by real-world actuators, and 3) validate the benefits of the proposed approach under experimental conditions.},

	abstract = {In this study, we consider the control problem of a hybrid actuation system that is composed of more than two different types of actuators. Even though actuators are one crucial component for developing a robot with many degrees of freedom, such as humanoid and exoskeleton robots, technical difficulties and costs complicate the development of new actuators. On the other hand, since different types of actuators provide various strengths and weaknesses, an efficient approach will probably combine different types of actuators to design a novel actuation system. The crucial issue for such a hybrid actuator is a method that distributes the necessary torque/force to different actuators for generating target movements. We propose using an optimal control method to find the torque distribution strategy for hybrid actuators. We consider an optimal torque distribution method for a pneumatic-electric (P-E) hybrid actuator model that is used in our newly developed exoskeleton robot XoR. We present a control approach with a trajectory-based optimal control method with minimum energy criterion. Focusing on the robot's ankle joint, we apply our control method in numerical simulations and demonstrate that it reasonably finds the optimal torque distribution strategy based on the nature of the given task, and the results of high control performance.},

ROCR, pronounced “Rocker,” is a pendular, two-link, serial-chain robot that utilizes alternating handholds and an actuated tail to propel itself upward in a climbing style based on observation of human climbers and brachiating gibbons. ROCR's bioinspired pendular climbing strategy is simple and efficient. In fact, to our knowledge, ROCR is also the first climbing robot that is designed for efficiency. ROCR is a lightweight, flexible, and self-contained robot. This robot is intended for autonomous surveillance and inspection on sheer vertical surfaces. Potential locomotion gait strategies were investigated in simulation using Working Model 2D, and were evaluated on a basis of climbing rate, energy efficiency, and whether stable open-loop climbing was achieved. We identified that the most effective climbing resulted from sinusoidal tail motions. The addition of a body stabilizer reduced the robot's out-of-plane motion at higher frequencies and promoted more reliable gripper attachment. Experimental measurements of the robot showed climbing efficiencies of over 20\% and a specific resistance of 5.0, while consuming 27 J/m at a maximum climbing speed of 15.7 cm/s (0.34 body lengths/s) - setting a first benchmark for efficiency of climbing robots. Future work will include further design optimization, integration of more complex gripping mechanisms, and investigating more complex control strategies.},

Rather, the robot is equipped with passive joints, i.e., joints without actuator or sensor, which permit changing the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters such as the link length and twist angle. The passive joints will become controllable when the robot forms a closed kinematic chain. Also, each passive joint is equipped with a built-in brake mechanism that is normally locked, but the lock can be released whenever the parameters are to be changed. Such a versatile and agile robot is particularly suitable for space application for its simple, compact, and light design. The kinematics and recalibration of this kind of reconfigurable robot are thoroughly analyzed. A stable reconfiguration-control algorithm is devised to take the robot from one configuration to another by directly regulating the passive joints to the associated, desired DH parameters. Conditions for the observability and the controllability of the passive joints are also derived in detail.},

After providing a brief review of MINLP optimization, we present an overview of GDP for the case of convex functions emphasizing the quality of continuous relaxations of alternative reformulations that include the big-M and the hull relaxation. We then review disjunctive branch and bound as well as logic-based decomposition methods that circumvent some of the limitations in traditional MINLP optimization. We next consider the case of linear GDP problems to show how a hierarchy of relaxations can be developed by performing sequential intersection of disjunctions. Finally, for the case when the GDP problem involves nonconvex functions, we propose a scheme for tightening the lower bounds for obtaining the global optimum using a combined disjunctive and spatial branch and bound search. We illustrate the application of the theoretical concepts and algorithms on several engineering and OR problems.},

The defining feature of all our periodic solutions is that all collisions are at zero relative velocity. These motions are found using numerical integration and root-finding that is sufficiently precise so as to imply that the solutions found correspond to mathematical solutions with exactly zero energy cost. The only actuation and control in the model is for maintaining contact with and releasing handholds which requires no mechanical work.

The design principle of a leg called a gravitationally decoupled actuator (GDA) is shown to be indispensable for realizing energetically efficient walking mo tion. A novel mechanism, the three-dimensional Cartesian- coordinate pantograph (PANTOMEC), which follows the GDA principle and has a lightweight structure, is introduced. A constructed quadruped walking vehicle model is then de scribed : the walking vehicle has the PANTOMEC leg mecha nisms, eight tactile sensors and a posture detector, and is hierarchically controlled by a microcomputer. Comparatively high energy efficiency and a certain degree of terrain adapt ability is demonstrated. It is thus shown that a practical walking vehicle can be designed using the proposed method.
The adaptive gait control problem is formalized, and an algorithm for terrain-adaptive gait control is presented. By computer simulation, it is shown that the algorithm produces an efficient gait while avoiding "deadlock" positions in nego tiating terrain. The algorithm is shown to be applicable for the control of future quadruped walking vehicles with visual sensors.},

We present a design framework that employs dynamic couplings in the form of brakes and clutches to increase the performance and diversity of linear actuators. The couplings are used to switch between a diverse range of discrete modes of operation within a single actuator. We also provide a design solution for miniaturized couplings that use dry friction to produce rapid switching and high braking forces. The couplings are designed so that once engaged or disengaged no extra energy is consumed. We apply the design framework and coupling design to a linear series elastic actuator (SEA) and show that this relatively simple implementation increases the performance and adds new behaviours to the standard design. Through a number of performance tests we are able to show rapid switching between a high and a low impedance output mode; that the actuator's spring can be charged to produce short bursts of high output power; and that the actuator has additional passive and rigid modes that consume no power once activated. Robots using actuators from this design framework would see a vast increase in their behavioural diversity and improvements in their performance not yet possible with conventional actuator design.},

One of the difficulties engendered by contact tasks is that they require intimate dynamic interaction between the robot and its environment. That interaction changes the performance of the robot and can jeopardize the stability of its control system. A discussion is presented of the problem of preserving the stability of a manipulator's control system during contact tasks. It will be shown that contact stability may be guaranteed if the control system provides the manipulator with an appropriately structured dynamic response to environmental inputs. Two aspects of one implementation of such a controller will be considered. Robustness to large errors in the manipulator kinematic equations and to unmodeled interface dynamics is shown},

Three major energy loss modes during locomotion are heat losses through the actuators, losses through the transmission, and the interaction losses that includes all losses of the system interacting with the environment. We propose four design principles that minimize these losses: employment of high torque density motors, low impedance transmission, energy regenerative electronics and a design architecture that minimizes the leg inertia. We present the design features of the MIT cheetah robot as an embodiment of these principles.

	abstract = {Direct drive is an ideal drive method which has excellent features including no backlash, low friction, and high mechanical stiffness. Applying the direct drive method to robot arms, however, leads to an impractical design because of the following two drawbacks. One is that a direct-drive arm tends to be heavier than a conventional arm with transmission mechanisms; because the motors of direct-drive arm are located at each joint of the arm the weight of each motor is a load to the previous motors down the serial linkage of the arm. Another problem is insufficient drive torques due to the elimination of gears which amplify the motor torques. This paper describes a lightweight arm mechanism for the direct-drive robots. The major improvements are: (1) the serial link mechanism is replaced by a four-bar-link mechanism in order to avoid the mounting of heavy motors at the serial links, (2) high performance brushless motors have been developed so that large torques can be obtained with relatively small power dissipation. Throughout the basic analysis and experiments, the arm which has been developed is evaluated in terms of efficiency, load capacity and dynamic response.},

	abstract = {The electric vehicle is becoming increasingly prevalent as a viable option to replace hydrocarbon fuelled vehicles, and as such the development of high efficiency fully electric drivetrains is a particularly relevant research topic. The drivetrain topology is one of the main focuses of research on fully electric drivetrains, because of the variety of available options. For example, the adoption of multiple-speed mechanical transmissions can improve both the performance and energy consumption when compared to a single-speed transmission. A four-speed, dual motor drivetrain design is presented in this article which works on the principle of two double-speed transmissions, each driven by a separate motor linked through a sole secondary shaft. This drivetrain architecture provides increased flexibility of the electric motor operating points, theoretically being beneficial to the overall efficiency of the system for any driving condition. This paper presents the design of the transmission, its governing equations and the method adopted to optimize the state selection map and electric motor torque distribution. A backward-facing energy consumption model is used to compare the results of the four-speed transmission with those of single- and double-speed transmissions for four case study vehicles. © 2012 IEEE.},

The three gear ratios of a transmission system can maintain the motor speed within a stable region with relatively high energy efficiency, while various vehicle speeds are needed. This work is based on a light EV prototype. The optimized gear ratios of this transmission result in a considerably reduced energy consumption of 9.3\% compared with conventional EVs with single-speed reducers under the condition of the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule driving cycle.

A necessary and sufficient condition to ensure the stability of a linear manipulator coupled at a single interaction port to a linear, passive environment is found. It is shown that this condition may be extended to a broad class of active environments, and a simple test for coupled stability, based on the root locus, is presented. Two interaction controller designs for a linear manipulator are presented. Interactive behaviour is analysed in the frequency domain by comparison with the behaviour of a target model. A simple controller shows strong stability properties, but poor behaviour; a more sophisticated design shows that it is possible to achieve desirable behaviour while retaining stability guarantees.},

A high level of reliability, the redundancy, and the compactness are required for aircraft electrical actuators. For achieving these purposes, a classical solution consists in using two identical actuators motorized by one permanent magnet (PM) motor supplied by a voltage source inverter (VSI). In this paper, a solution based on the use of only one fault-tolerant actuator performed by a two-star connected-winding (two-channel) PM motor supplied by two pulsewidth modulated VSIs is proposed. The design of the PM motor can be achieved in two different ways, which are proposed and studied in this paper. The authors focus this paper on the comparison between the two winding architectures and compare the two motors in terms of the short-circuit current and magnetic decoupling of the two windings.

The modularization and integration of the robot components enable low complexity in the design and assembly. The hybrid actuation concept has been validated on a two-degree-of-freedom prototype arm. The experimental results show the significant improvement that can be achieved with hybrid actuation over an actuation system with pneumatic artificial muscles alone.

The gear shift operation is stated as a multistage decision process by making use of the dynamic programming method. Thereby, the synchronization of the gear box is formulated as a constraint at the end of the process. A control law is derived analytically in an explicit form by minimizing the performance measure over each process stage. Simulation results show a significant improvement in terms of gear shift comfort by different driving load cases. Furthermore, the shift time and the frictional losses in the shift elements can be reduced by applying the proposed control.},

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatible robots can assist physicians with the insertion of biopsy needles and needle-like therapeutic instruments directly into millimeter-size tumors, using MR images as feedback. However, MRI systems present a challenging environment with high magnetic fields and limited space, making the development of MRI-compatible robots complex. This paper presents an MRI-compatible pneumatic actuation technology consisting of molded polymer structures with embedded air-muscles operated in a binary fashion. Along with its good positioning accuracy, the technology presents advantages of compactness, perfect MRI-compatibility, simplicity and low cost. Here, we specifically report the design and validation of a transperineal prostate cancer manipulator prototype that has 20 embedded air-muscles distributed in four star-like polymer structures. These compliant structures are made of silicone elastomer, using lost-core injection molding. Low motion hysteresis and good precision are achieved by designing molded joints that eliminate sliding surfaces. An effective design method for such embedded polymer air-muscles is proposed, using a manipulator model and four air-muscle design models: geometrical, finite elements, uniaxial analytic, and experimental. Binary control of each air-muscle ensures stability and accuracy with minimized costs and complexity. The prototype is found MRI-compatible with no observable effects on the signal-to-noise ratio and, with appropriate image feedback, is found to reach targets with precision and accuracy under 0.5 mm. The embedded approach reveals to be a key feature since it reduces hysteresis errors by a factor of ≈7 compared to a previous nonembedded version of the manipulator. The successful validation of this binary manipulator opens the door to a new design paradigm for low cost and highly capable pneumatic robots.},

The film's viscous forces increase actuator life and the short power-on times minimize energy losses through current leakage. This paper presents a design paradigm that exploits these fundamental properties of DEAs called discrete actuation. Discrete actuation uses DEAs at high stretch rates to change the states of robotic or mechatronic systems in discrete steps. Each state of the system is stable and can be maintained without actuator power. Discrete actuation can be used in robotic and mechatronic applications such as manipulation and locomotion. The resolution of such systems increases with the number of discrete states, 10 to 100 being sufficient for many applications. An MRI-guided needle positioning device for cancer treatments and a space exploration robot using hopping for locomotion are presented as examples of this concept.},

In this paper, we tried to use machine learning to build algorithms that could automatically identify, judge, and predict flow patterns and droplet characteristics, so that the empirical judgment was transferred to be an intelligent process. The difference on the usual machine learning algorithms, a generalized variable system was introduced to describe the different geometry configurations of the digital microfluidics. Specifically, Buckingham’s theorem had been adopted to obtain multiple groups of dimensionless numbers as the input variables of machine learning algorithms. Through the verification of the algorithms, the {SVM} and {BPNN} algorithms had classified and predicted the different flow patterns and droplet characteristics (the length and frequency) successfully. By comparing with the primitive parameters system, the dimensionless numbers system was superior in the predictive capability. The traditional dimensionless numbers selected for the machine learning algorithms should have physical meanings strongly rather than mathematical meanings. The machine learning algorithms applying the dimensionless numbers had declined the dimensionality of the system and the amount of computation and not lose the information of primitive parameters.},

However, predicting wind power potential is a complex problem because of unpredictable wind patterns, particularly in urban areas. In this study, by using computational fluid dynamics ({CFD}) and the concept of nondimensionality, with the help of machine learning techniques, we demonstrate a new method for predicting the wind power potential of a cluster of roof-mounted wind turbines over an actual urban area in Montreal, Canada. {CFD} simulations are achieved using city fast fluid dynamics ({CityFFD}), developed for urban microclimate simulations. The random forest model trains data generated by {CityFFD} for wind prediction. The accuracy of {CityFFD} is investigated by modeling an actual urban area and comparing the numerical data with measured data from a local weather station.

	abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning ({DRL}) has proven to be an effective framework for solving various complex control problems. In manufacturing, industrial robots can be trained to learn dexterous manipulation skills from raw pixels with {DRL}. However, training robots in the real world is a time-consuming, high-cost and of safety concerns process. A frequently adopted approach for easing this is to train robots through simulations first and then deploy algorithms (or policies) on physical robots. How to transfer policies of robot learning from simulation to the real world is a challenging issue. Digital twin that is able to create a dynamic, up-to-date representation of a physical robotic grasping system provides an effective approach for addressing this issue. In this paper, we focus on the scenario of {DRL}-based assembly-oriented industrial grasping and propose a digital twin-enabled approach for achieving effective transfer of {DRL} algorithms to a physical robot. Two parallel training systems, i.e., the physical robotic system and corresponding digital twin system, respectively, are established, which take virtual and real images as inputs. The output of the digital twin system is used to correct the real grasping point so that accurate grasping can be achieved. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the intelligent grasping algorithm and the digital twin-enabled sim-to-real transfer approach and mechanism.},

But the behaviours developed by agents in simulation are often specific to the characteristics of the simulator. Due to modeling error, strategies that are successful in simulation may not transfer to their real world counterparts. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple method to bridge this "reality gap". By randomizing the dynamics of the simulator during training, we are able to develop policies that are capable of adapting to very different dynamics, including ones that differ significantly from the dynamics on which the policies were trained. This adaptivity enables the policies to generalize to the dynamics of the real world without any training on the physical system. Our approach is demonstrated on an object pushing task using a robotic arm. Despite being trained exclusively in simulation, our policies are able to maintain a similar level of performance when deployed on a real robot, reliably moving an object to a desired location from random initial configurations. We explore the impact of various design decisions and show that the resulting policies are robust to significant calibration error.},

	abstract = {Modern reinforcement learning methods suffer from low sample efficiency and unsafe exploration, making it infeasible to train robotic policies entirely on real hardware. In this work, we propose to address the problem of sim-to-real domain transfer by using meta learning to train a policy that can adapt to a variety of dynamic conditions, and using a task-specific trajectory generation model to provide an action space that facilitates quick exploration. We evaluate the method by performing domain adaptation in simulation and analyzing the structure of the latent space during adaptation. We then deploy this policy on a {KUKA} {LBR} 4+ robot and evaluate its performance on a task of hitting a hockey puck to a target.

	abstract = {Control strategies for active prostheses or orthoses use sensor inputs to recognize the user's locomotive intention and generate corresponding control commands for producing the desired locomotion. In this paper, we propose a learning-based shared model for predicting ankle-joint motion for different locomotion modes like level-ground walking, stair ascent, stair descent, slope ascent, and slope descent without the need to classify between them. Features extracted from hip and knee joint angular motion are used to continuously predict the ankle angles and moments using a Feed-Forward Neural Network-based shared model. We show that the shared model is adequate for predicting the ankle angles and moments for different locomotion modes without explicitly classifying between the modes. The proposed strategy shows the potential for devising a high-level controller for an intelligent prosthetic ankle that can adapt to different locomotion modes.},

	abstract = {Although reinforcement learning methods can achieve impressive results in simulation, the real world presents two major challenges: generating samples is exceedingly expensive, and unexpected perturbations or unseen situations cause proficient but specialized policies to fail at test time. Given that it is impractical to train separate policies to accommodate all situations the agent may see in the real world, this work proposes to learn how to quickly and effectively adapt online to new tasks. To enable sample-efficient learning, we consider learning online adaptation in the context of model-based reinforcement learning. Our approach uses meta-learning to train a dynamics model prior such that, when combined with recent data, this prior can be rapidly adapted to the local context. Our experiments demonstrate online adaptation for continuous control tasks on both simulated and real-world agents. We first show simulated agents adapting their behavior online to novel terrains, crippled body parts, and highly-dynamic environments. We also illustrate the importance of incorporating online adaptation into autonomous agents that operate in the real world by applying our method to a real dynamic legged millirobot. We demonstrate the agent's learned ability to quickly adapt online to a missing leg, adjust to novel terrains and slopes, account for miscalibration or errors in pose estimation, and compensate for pulling payloads.},

	abstract = {In the robotics literature, different knowledge transfer approaches have been proposed to leverage the experience from a source task or robot -- real or virtual -- to accelerate the learning process on a new task or robot. A commonly made but infrequently examined assumption is that incorporating experience from a source task or robot will be beneficial. In practice, inappropriate knowledge transfer can result in negative transfer or unsafe behaviour. In this work, inspired by a system gap metric from robust control theory, the \${\textbackslash}nu\$-gap, we present a data-efficient algorithm for estimating the similarity between pairs of robot systems. In a multi-source inter-robot transfer learning setup, we show that this similarity metric allows us to predict relative transfer performance and thus informatively select experiences from a source robot before knowledge transfer. We demonstrate our approach with quadrotor experiments, where we transfer an inverse dynamics model from a real or virtual source quadrotor to enhance the tracking performance of a target quadrotor on arbitrary hand-drawn trajectories. We show that selecting experiences based on the proposed similarity metric effectively facilitates the learning of the target quadrotor, improving performance by 62\% compared to a poorly selected experience.},

It is also prohibitively expensive to learn a new policy from scratch for each robot hardware due to the high sample complexity of modern state-of-the-art algorithms. We propose a novel approach called Hardware Conditioned Policies where we train a universal policy conditioned on a vector representation of robot hardware. We considered robots in simulation with varied dynamics, kinematic structure, kinematic lengths and degrees-of-freedom. First, we use the kinematic structure directly as the hardware encoding and show great zero-shot transfer to completely novel robots not seen during training. For robots with lower zero-shot success rate, we also demonstrate that fine-tuning the policy network is significantly more sample-efficient than training a model from scratch. In tasks where knowing the agent dynamics is important for success, we learn an embedding for robot hardware and show that policies conditioned on the encoding of hardware tend to generalize and transfer well.

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning ({RL}) can automate a wide variety of robotic skills, but learning each new skill requires considerable real-world data collection and manual representation engineering to design policy classes or features. Using deep reinforcement learning to train general purpose neural network policies alleviates some of the burden of manual representation engineering by using expressive policy classes, but exacerbates the challenge of data collection, since such methods tend to be less efficient than {RL} with low-dimensional, hand-designed representations. Transfer learning can mitigate this problem by enabling us to transfer information from one skill to another and even from one robot to another. We show that neural network policies can be decomposed into "task-specific" and "robot-specific" modules, where the task-specific modules are shared across robots, and the robot-specific modules are shared across all tasks on that robot. This allows for sharing task information, such as perception, between robots and sharing robot information, such as dynamics and kinematics, between tasks. We exploit this decomposition to train mix-and-match modules that can solve new robot-task combinations that were not seen during training. Using a novel neural network architecture, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our transfer method for enabling zero-shot generalization with a variety of robots and tasks in simulation for both visual and non-visual tasks.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning is typically concerned with learning control policies tailored to a particular agent. We investigate whether there exists a single global policy that can generalize to control a wide variety of agent morphologies – ones in which even dimensionality of state and action spaces changes. We propose to express this global policy as a collection of identical modular neural networks, dubbed as Shared Modular Policies ({SMP}), that correspond to each of the agent’s actuators. Every module is only responsible for controlling its corresponding actuator and receives information from only its local sensors. In addition, messages are passed between modules, propagating information between distant modules. We show that a single modular policy can successfully generate locomotion behaviors for several planar agents with different skeletal structures such as monopod hoppers, quadrupeds, bipeds, and generalize to variants not seen during training – a process that would normally require training and manual hyperparameter tuning for each morphology. We observe that a wide variety of drastically diverse locomotion styles across morphologies as well as centralized coordination emerges via message passing between decentralized modules purely from the reinforcement learning objective.

	abstract = {Robot learning has emerged as a promising tool for taming the complexity and diversity of the real world. Methods based on high-capacity models, such as deep networks, hold the promise of providing effective generalization to a wide range of open-world environments. However, these same methods typically require large amounts of diverse training data to generalize effectively. In contrast, most robotic learning experiments are small-scale, single-domain, and single-robot. This leads to a frequent tension in robotic learning: how can we learn generalizable robotic controllers without having to collect impractically large amounts of data for each separate experiment? In this paper, we propose {RoboNet}, an open database for sharing robotic experience, which provides an initial pool of 15 million video frames, from 7 different robot platforms, and study how it can be used to learn generalizable models for vision-based robotic manipulation. We combine the dataset with two different learning algorithms: visual foresight, which uses forward video prediction models, and supervised inverse models. Our experiments test the learned algorithms' ability to work across new objects, new tasks, new scenes, new camera viewpoints, new grippers, or even entirely new robots. In our final experiment, we find that by pre-training on {RoboNet} and fine-tuning on data from a held-out Franka or Kuka robot, we can exceed the performance of a robot-specific training approach that uses 4x-20x more data.

The control scheme is designed to improve drivers’ comfort during normal, safe-driving situations and to completely avoid rear-end collision in vehicle-following situations. Driving situations are divided into safe, warning, and dangerous modes. Three different control strategies have been proposed, depending on the driving situation. The driving situations are determined using a non-dimensional warning index and the time-to-collision (TTC). The control parameters of the proposed ACC/CA system are tuned by a confusion-matrix method using manual-driving data in no-crashing driving situations. The vehicle-following characteristics of the subject vehicle were compared to real-world, manual-driving data. Finally, the ACC/CA system was also implemented in a real vehicle and tested in both safe-traffic and severe-braking situations. It is shown that the proposed control strategy can provide natural following performance that is similar to human manual-driving in both high-speed driving and low-speed stop-and-go situations. Furthermore, it can prevent the vehicle-to-vehicle distance from dropping to an unsafe level in a variety of driving conditions.},

The system works in three phases. In scanning phase, the parking environment is detected by ultrasonic sensors mounted on the robot and a parking position and manoeuvring path is produced if the space is sufficient. Then in the positioning phase, the robot reverses to the edge of the parking space avoiding potential collisions. Finally, in manoeuvring phase, the robot moves to the parking position in the parking space in a unified pattern, which may requires backward and forward manoeuvres depending on the dimensions of the parking space. Motion characteristics of this kind of robots are modeled, taking into account the nonholonomic constraints acting on the car-like robot. A collision-free path is planned in reference to the surroundings.

On this basis, an iterative identification procedure is schemed, and the kinematics and identification simulations are carried out. The kinematics simulation results show that the proposed {FKS} has wider convergence range and faster computation speed than Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, while the identification simulation results show that the residual pose errors with the proposed dimensionless {EMMs} are lower than that with the conventional {EMM} in various units. Additionally, the procedure of the full pose measurement with a laser tracker and an auxiliary tool is introduced, and thereby the contrast experiments of kinematic calibration on the prototype are conducted. The experiment results indicate that the residual position and orientation errors based on the dimensionless {EMM} decrease by 97.67\% and 86.85\% of the original values, respectively, at least, and by 76.77\% and 38.65\% of that based on the conventional {EMM}, respectively, at most. Consequently, it is further confirmed that the proposed calibration method is effective in enhancing the identification accuracy of the geometric errors and improving the positioning accuracy of the studied parallel robot.},

	abstract = {Currently autonomous or self-driving vehicles are at the heart of academia and industry research because of its multi-faceted advantages that includes improved safety, reduced congestion, lower emissions and greater mobility. Software is the key driving factor underpinning autonomy within which planning algorithms that are responsible for mission-critical decision making hold a signiﬁcant position. While transporting passengers or goods from a given origin to a given destination, motion planning methods incorporate searching for a path to follow, avoiding obstacles and generating the best trajectory that ensures safety, comfort and efﬁciency. A range of different planning approaches have been proposed in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to review existing approaches and then compare and contrast different methods employed for the motion planning of autonomous on-road driving that consists of (1) ﬁnding a path, (2) searching for the safest manoeuvre and (3) determining the most feasible trajectory. Methods developed by researchers in each of these three levels exhibit varying levels of complexity and performance accuracy. This paper presents a critical evaluation of each of these methods, in terms of their advantages/disadvantages, inherent limitations, feasibility, optimality, handling of obstacles and testing operational environments.},

	abstract = {Academic research in the field of autonomous vehicles has reached high popularity in recent years related to several topics as sensor technologies, V2X communications, safety, security, decision making, control, and even legal and standardization rules. Besides classic control design approaches, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning methods are present in almost all of these fields. Another part of research focuses on different layers of Motion Planning, such as strategic decisions, trajectory planning, and control. A wide range of techniques in Machine Learning itself have been developed, and this article describes one of these fields, Deep Reinforcement Learning ({DRL}). The paper provides insight into the hierarchical motion planning problem and describes the basics of {DRL}. The main elements of designing such a system are the modeling of the environment, the modeling abstractions, the description of the state and the perception models, the appropriate rewarding, and the realization of the underlying neural network. The paper describes vehicle models, simulation possibilities and computational requirements. Strategic decisions on different layers and the observation models, e.g., continuous and discrete state representations, grid-based, and camera-based solutions are presented. The paper surveys the state-of-art solutions systematized by the different tasks and levels of autonomous driving, such as car-following, lane-keeping, trajectory following, merging, or driving in dense traffic. Finally, open questions and future challenges are discussed.},

	title = {Improving Elevator Performance Using Reinforcement Learning},
	abstract = {This paper describes the application of reinforcement learning ({RL}) to the difficult real world problem of elevator dispatching. The elevator domain poses a combination of challenges not seen in most {RL} research to date. Elevator systems operate in continuous state spaces and in continuous time as discrete event dynamic systems. Their states are not fully observable and they are nonstationary due to changing passenger arrival rates. In addition, we use a team of {RL} agents, each of which is responsible for controlling one elevator car. The team receives a global reinforcement signal which appears noisy to each agent due to the effects of the actions of the other agents, the random nature of the arrivals and the incomplete observation of the state. In spite of these complications, we show results that in simulation surpass the best of the heuristic elevator control algorithms of which we are aware. These results demonstrate the power of {RL} on a very large scale stochastic dynamic optimization problem of practical utility.},

Researchers have argued that {DP} provides the appropriate basis for compiling planning results into reactive strategies for real-time control, as well as for learning such strategies when the system being controlled is incompletely known. We introduce an algorithm based on {DP}, which we call Real-Time {DP} ({RTDP}), by which an embedded system can improve its performance with experience. {RTDP} generalizes Korf’s Learning-Real-Time-A* algorithm to problems involving uncertainty. We invoke results from the theory of asynchronous {DP} to prove that {RTDP} achieves optimal behavior in several different classes of problems. We also use the theory of asynchronous {DP} to illuminate aspects of other {DP}-based reinforcement learning methods such as Watkins’ Q-Learning algorithm. A secondary aim of this article is to provide a bridge between {AI} research on real-time planning and learning and relevant concepts and algorithms from control theory.},

	abstract = {Recent progress in artificial intelligence has renewed interest in building systems that learn and think like people. Many advances have come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats that of humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (1) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (2) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (3) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete challenges and promising routes toward these goals that can combine the strengths of recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive models.},

	abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning ({DRL}) has proven to be an effective framework for solving various complex control problems. In manufacturing, industrial robots can be trained to learn dexterous manipulation skills from raw pixels with {DRL}. However, training robots in the real world is a time-consuming, high-cost and of safety concerns process. A frequently adopted approach for easing this is to train robots through simulations first and then deploy algorithms (or policies) on physical robots. How to transfer policies of robot learning from simulation to the real world is a challenging issue. Digital twin that is able to create a dynamic, up-to-date representation of a physical robotic grasping system provides an effective approach for addressing this issue. In this paper, we focus on the scenario of {DRL}-based assembly-oriented industrial grasping and propose a digital twin-enabled approach for achieving effective transfer of {DRL} algorithms to a physical robot. Two parallel training systems, i.e., the physical robotic system and corresponding digital twin system, respectively, are established, which take virtual and real images as inputs. The output of the digital twin system is used to correct the real grasping point so that accurate grasping can be achieved. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the intelligent grasping algorithm and the digital twin-enabled sim-to-real transfer approach and mechanism.},
